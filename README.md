Keep my files updated while I learn Android Development on Android Studio

This is practice for a [Time Management App](https://github.com/salahusama/Time-Stamper) I want to build.

I am learning all this by myself in my own time.

## What I learnt:
* Android Studio Interface and main parts of a project
* Basic Android development
* OpenGL - graphics in an App _(basic)_
